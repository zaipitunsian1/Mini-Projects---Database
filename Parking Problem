Parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.


Language is Python 3 (Maybe 3.5 or 3.7), just do check it how beautifully it works:-

class ParkingSystem:
  def __init__(self, big, medium, small):
    self.slots = {1: big, 2: medium, 3: small}
 
  def addCar(self, carType):
    
    if self.slots[carType] == 0:
        return False
    else:
        self.slots[carType] -= 1
        return True
